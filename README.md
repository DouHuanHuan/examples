# Kubernetes Examples

This directory contains a number of examples of how to run real applications
with Kubernetes.

Refer to the [Kubernetes documentation] for how to execute the tutorials.

### Maintained Examples

Maintained Examples are expected to be updated with every Kubernetes release, to
use the latest and greatest features, current guidelines and best practices,
and to refresh command syntax, output, changed prerequisites, as needed.

> Note: Please add examples that are maintained to the list above.

See [Example Guidelines](guidelines.md) for a description of what goes
in this directory, and what examples should contain.
